Joe and Rob are professional musicians with decades of experience as premiere performers in restaurants, bars, and night clubs locally and nationally. They form the core of The Old Guyz, a fluid eclectic music group which may feature the accompanyment of a variety of talented musicians and interesting characters. Their sound is mellow yet soulful and strong, perfectly suited to a coffee lounge or upscale brunch. The songs they cover are selected from across multiple genres and decades and include many current song and unique arrangements as well as everyones favorite standards. The Old Guyz also perform love songs for Valentines Day, traditional Irish folk music on Saint Patrick's Day, patriotic songs on the 4th, and Christmas Carols the month of December.
